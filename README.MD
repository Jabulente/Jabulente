<h1 style='font-size: 15px'>ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jabulente</h1>

Iâ€™m Jabulente, a passionate Data Analyst and Research Specialist with a background in Crop Science. My work bridges the gap between agricultural science and data science, using real-world data to solve complex problems in food systems, environmental sustainability, and rural development. Whether Iâ€™m building machine learning models, analyzing soil-crop interactions, or designing research frameworks, my goal is clear: to empower evidence-based decision-making through data.

<h4 align="center" font-family="Candara"> Graduate from University of Tutorial </h4>

With a background in crop science, I somehow managed to turn a hobby into a career. Through thousands of hours spent watching tutorials, reading books and blogs, and building countless projects, I taught myself the skills needed to thrive in tech. Today, I primarily work as a Software Engineer, blending engineering logic with self-driven creativity.



#### What I'm good at

I have rich experience in analyzing complex datasets to develop data-driven solutions that inform decision-making and drive impact. I specialize in data visualization, statistical modeling, machine learning, and geospatial analysis using tools like Python and R. Iâ€™ve worked on diverse projects involving trend analysis, predictive modeling, sentiment analysis, and report automationâ€”helping clients and teams uncover insights, optimize processes, and solve real-world problems through clean, interpretable data.
